In this workshop I learned how to compile modules, create modules and make sure that it runs as a whole program. 
The part one was to create modules from the given code, pretty self explainotary. For the second part I was asked to create a different
function from the scracth. What I did is I created a single function where it open the text file and than ask the user for a name. If the textfile is not found
than the program will send an error message saying that the file was not found. If the programme finds the textfile then it will 
ask the user to give it a name. The I created a boolean If loop to compare the user's string with the strings in the textfile. If the 
programs find any match then it will display the output in the programme. If not than the program will keep asking the user for an input. This is what
I learned during the lectures and how to use namespace.
