This workshop was based on the allcation and deallocation of memory within the code. For the first part we created a program thats record the
entry of a car while crossing the border. So as there will be many cars passing throught the border, we need an car array. This array will be needing
a space on memory to keep the car list in it. And once the program is done it will it won't need any space. So first we allocated a memory space in 
to the car array, means giving a specific value to the size of the car. Then we cannot just keep the the array with the allocated memory
because this will cause a memory leak. Apart from that I did mamake functions for searching the strings which is the car name and model with 
license plate numbers.

For the second part we created a program which takes the user string and finds if the string is in the excel sheet. Some things were similar
as the workshop 1 where we start the program by opening the file so that the prgam can compare and find the same data and display it as an output.
Addition to that we had to allocate and deallocate memory. So of course we had to allocate a memory space to the dna array and deallocate the dna
array memory. Yes we reused the cStrTools module from the workshop 1 in this workshop 2 for both parts.
