I learnt what "Constructors and Destructors" are throughout this course.
Let me try to put everything I've learnt about these two functions so far into words.
Class is a new data type, and we can't make it up as we go along; nevertheless, we can make it up as we go along.
Making a class, which is simply a specification for a new data type.
As a result, constructors are special class functions that are used to execute certain tasks.
initialization of each and every object As a result, anytime we wish to make an object,
We employ these special functions known as 'Constructors' within a class.
Constructors are also used to provide information to our objects.
Because most of the time we work with hundreds or thousands of objects, 
instead of defining them one by one manually, we may immediately send the values within the function 
Object() { [native code] } in this situation. That would take a significant amount of time.

Here's an example from our workshop: 
we had Contructor set the settings for us.

- CarInventory(const char* type, const char* brand, const char* model, int year = 2022, int code = 100, double price = 1);

On the other hand, Destructors' job is to dellocate memory before they exit scope.
Furthermore, before  each object exiting the scope, they are invokes by the 'destructor' method.
